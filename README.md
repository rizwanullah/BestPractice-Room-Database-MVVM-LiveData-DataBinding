# BestPractice-Room-Database-MVVM-LiveData-DataBinding
I have created demo Android App that has local database using Room through you can insert, update, delete and can get all data. The project build on MVVM architecture with Databinding. I used Kotlin language. You can learn from this project how to use MVVM architecture plus Data Binding with integration of xml layouts, How to create Room Database and make queries.
